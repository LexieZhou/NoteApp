# Welcome to OmniNote Mobile App ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project using React Native.

## Get started

1. First, you have to start the backend server
   - Go to the backend folder.
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```
   - Follow the instruction there to start the server side.

2. From Mobile Devices
   To connect from your iPad or other mobile devices:
   - Make sure your mobile device is connected to the same WiFi network as the server
   - Find the network address of the server for accessing on the mobile device.
   - For example: 
      When running the server, it will be available at:
      - `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (localhost, for accessing from the same machine)
      - `http://26.26.26.1:8080` (local network address, for accessing from other devices)
   - Use the following command in your server's terminal to verify the actual IP address of your server
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   - Use the first IP address as the base URL in your mobile app
   - Go to /MobileNoteApp/hooks/api.ts and fill in the base API configuration
   ```bash
   const BASE_URL = 'http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8080/api';
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   npm install
   ```
