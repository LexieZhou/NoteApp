# Welcome to OmniNote Mobile App ðŸ‘‹

This is one of our final year project deliverables, check our [website](https://wp2024.cs.hku.hk/fyp24088/) for more project details.

It is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) mobile app project using React Native.

## Get started

1. First, you have to start the backend server
   - Go to the backend folder.
      ```bash
      cd ../backend
      ```
   - Follow the instruction there to start the server side.

2. Second, you have to find the server network address in order to connect from your mobile devices.
   - Make sure your mobile device is connected to the same WiFi network as the server
   - Find the network address of the server for accessing on the mobile device. For example: when running the server, it may be available at:
      - `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (localhost, for accessing from the same machine)
      - `http://26.26.26.1:8080` (local network address, for accessing from other devices)
   - Use the following command in your server's terminal to verify the actual IP address of your server
      ```bash
      ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
      ```
   - Use the first IP address as the base URL in your mobile app.
